This contains data related to that is used as the basis of the hemodynamic model, namely our integrated synaptic actvity
We have uploaded data from three datasets visual delayed match to sample task (high attention parameter with visual input), 
passive viewing (low attention parameter with visual inputs), and rest (low attention parameter withno inputs)
Each of these has been given its own Jupyter notebooks to show how we calculated the hemodynamics using the Heinzle model
We provide this code as an example of how the hemodynamic model can be switched for a more advanced model
